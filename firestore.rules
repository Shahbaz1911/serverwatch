/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ServerWatch application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * Each user has complete control over their own data and no access to other user's data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under the `/users/{userId}` collection, ensuring clear ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Default security posture is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is used in the path `/users/{userId}` and must match the `id` field in the User document to enforce path-based ownership.
